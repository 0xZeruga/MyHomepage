					A graduate of Game Development with 2 years of professional experience
					in a diverse career, from an indie game studio with less than a handful 
					employees to a gargantuan telecom giant. I have a wide variety of skills
					and spend a fair share of my spare time to refining those.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm always looking forward to meeting new people and to learn more as I
					help them solve their problems in areas related to cryptocurrencies & blockchain,
					game design, project management or software development.
