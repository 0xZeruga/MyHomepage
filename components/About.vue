					A graduate of Networking/Telecomms with {{ $store.state.yrs }} years of professional experience
					working in various web related roles, I have a wide range of skills;
					full stack development, user experience and design.

					However, I mainly focus on front end development but with experience
					in all these disciplines, I am able to work on any project
					with the full scope in mind; a valuable approach
					since I can easily provide insight and advice on all aspects of a project.
